# What SYNS-Colorado is

A local chapter of the Society of Young Network Scientists (SYNS). The goal of the broader organization is to support early-career network scientists as they pursue research, to promote their work, and to shape the evolving field of network science. Anyone who identifies as being early in their career is welcome, faculty included!
